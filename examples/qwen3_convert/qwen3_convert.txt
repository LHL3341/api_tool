**Task Description:**
Given a **text-only question**, determine whether it can be converted into an **“information-migration multimodal question.”**

**Definition of an information-migration multimodal question:**

* Key **conditions, structures, or relationships** in the question can be clearly represented through an image (e.g., geometric diagrams, force diagrams, chemical reaction schemes, circuit diagrams, function graphs, etc.).
* In the converted version, these elements are **migrated into the image**, and the **textual part only keeps the core inquiry**, such as “Find…,” “Determine whether…,” etc.
* If the image would only serve as decoration or cannot represent the main information, then the question is **Unconvertible**.

---

**Output Requirements:**

* If the question is **unconvertible**, output only:

  ```
  Reason: {{a short explanation of why this question is unconvertible}}
  Therefore the question is **Unconvertible**
  ```

* If the question **is convertible**, output in the following format:

  ```
  Reason: {{a short explanation of why this question is convertible}}
  Therefore the question is **Convertible**
  **Converted question**: {{the simplified textual question after migration，remove any conditions that are already represented in the image.}}
  **Detailed caption**: {{include layout, key conditions, structures, or relationships}}
  ```

Where:

* **“Detailed caption”** is a detailed textual description that conveys all key elements, conditions, structures, and spatial relationships that need to be visually represented in the image, enabling someone to reconstruct the diagram accurately. Include specific shapes, relative positions, orientations, arrows, labels, or other visual cues as needed (e.g., “positions of points A, B, and C with angle ∠A labeled,” “vectors showing the directions and magnitudes of the three forces acting on a solid circle representing the body,” “H₂ and Cl₂ molecules depicted as connected spheres with arrows showing reaction to form HCl”).
* **“Converted question”** should:
  * Start naturally, typically with phrases like “As shown in the figure…,” “Based on the diagram…,” “Find…,” etc.
  * Remove any conditions, numerical values, or structural descriptions that are already represented in the image.
  * Ensure that the converted question **depends on the image** to make sense.
  * For multiple-choice questions, **do not delete the options**.

** Negative Examples (What *Not* to Do):**

When converting, **do not repeat information in the textual question that has already been migrated into the image**.
The textual part should rely on the diagram for all descriptive and numerical information.
